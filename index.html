                    <p>A <b>CSS pseudo-element</b> is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).<br />
                    For example, it can be used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Style the first letter, or line, of an element</li>

                    <h2>Flexbox</h2>
                    <p>A CSS3 layout mode that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No floats!</li>
                        <li>Responsive and mobile friendly</li>
                        <li>Positioning child elements is much easier</li>
                        <li>Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents</li>
                        <li>Order of elements can be easily changed without editing the source HTML</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Flexbox Model Concenpt</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ability to alter item width and height to best fit in its containers available free space</li>
                        <li>Flexbox is direction-agnostic, means it works for both horizetal axis and vertical axis</li>
                        <li>Built for small scale layouts while the upcoming "Grid" specification is for more large scale</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Flex Properties</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>display: flex | inline</li>
                        <li>flex-direction: defines the direction of the child elements, its a parent property. row(default) | column</li>
                        <li>flex-wrap: if the screen sizes changes and you want the content to be wraped, use the "wrap" property. wrap | nowrap | wrapreverse</li>
                        <li>flex-basis: defines the width of the child element like "width" property. But it is more flexy. <br />
                            Rather than "width" use "flex-basis" in "flexboxes" &lt;length&gt;</li>
                        <li>justify-content: Aligns the child elements horizantally. By defalaul, the child elements takes the whole width of the flexbox, first we will <br />
                            give width to the child elements so that the parent container can have some empty space. Now we can <br />
                            arrange the child elements horizentally by this property. flex-start(default) | flex-end | center | <br />
                            space-between (gives margins between the child elements) | space-around (give margins on both sides of child element)</li>
                        <li>align-self: felx-start | flex-end | center</li>
                        <li>align-items: Aligns the child elements vertically. By default, the height of all child elements is same (stretch), if you want to give it the height<br />
                            according to the content in it, use this parent property. flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch</li>
                        <li>align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center</li>
                        <li>flex-grow: &lt;length&gt;</li>
                        <li>flex-shrink: &lt;length&gt;</li>
                        <li>flex: defines length of the child item. &lt;length&gt;</li>
                        <li>order: defines order of the child item, will everyone its oreder to work perfectly. &lt;length&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <!-- Grid -->
                    <h2>Grid</h2>
                    <p>Grid allows us to create two dimentional layouts on a webpage, and align items in <br />
                    both columns and rows.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>display: gird - Initiates the grid property</li>
                        <li>grid-template-columns: Parent property, give widths to each child to see the effect</li>
                        <li>grid-column-gap (now column-gap): defines the gape between columns. values: any css unit like 1em</li>
                        <li>grid-row-gap: defines the gape between rows. values: any css unit like 1em</li>
                        <li>grid-gap: shorthand for grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap</li>
                        <li>grid-auto-rows: defines the fixed height of the elements in the rows. For flexible height <br />
                        use grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto); - By default the height will be 100px but if the content <br />
                        goes beyond that height, it will stretch out to fill the content.</li>
                        <li>jsutify-items: Align items horizantally. start | center | end | stretch (default)</li>
                        <li>align-items: Align items vertically. start | center | end | stretch (default)</li>
                        <li>align-self and justify-self: Child property which aligns the child elements both horizantally and vertically.</li>
                        <li>grid-column: Stretches the child element horizantally. e.g: grid-column: 1/3; stretches the element from one to three horizantally.</li>
                        <li>grid-row: Stretches the child element vertically. e.g: grid-row: 1/3; stretches the element from one to three vertically.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In "grid-template-columns" use "fractions" instead of other CSS units as other units you gonna run into margins issues.<br />
                    1fr 2fr means the second column will be double of the first column.<br />
                    Examples: <br />
                    - 1fr 2fr 1fr - First and third column will be same width and the second will be the double<br />
                    - 1fr 1fr 1fr = repeat(3, 1fr) - Repeat three times 1fr.<br />
                    - 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr = repeat(4, 1fr 2fr)</p>

                    <!-- Media Queries -->
                    <h2>Media Queries</h2>
                    <p>- Allows us to create CSS rules based on various parameters (viewport size, device type etc).<br />
                    - We can arrange our layout to suite a wide variety of different / screen sizes.</p>
                    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
                    <p>@media &lt;media-type&gt; and (expression) { CSS code } <br />
                    - media-types: scree | print | TV | speech or all</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>- @media TV and (min-width: 1200px) {} <br />
                    - @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {} - apply the CSS when the screen is 800px and less, if the screen is bigger than 800px then do not apply the rules. <br />
                    - @media (orientation: landscape/portrait) and (max-width: 700px) {} <br />
                    - @media (orientation: portrait) {}</p>
    
                    <!-- min-widht / max-width -->
                    <!-- Max-Width -->
                    <h2>Max-Width</h2>
                    <p>Defines the max-width of the media, when we set the media width say "max-width: 900px" <br />
                    and now if we increase the media size more than 900px, the defined size will remain 900px.</p>
                    <!-- Min-Width -->
                    <h2>Min-Width</h2>
                    <p>Defines the min-width of the media, when we set the media width say "min-width: 378px" <br />
                    and now if we decrease the media size less than 378px, the defined size will remain 378px.</p>
                    <p>No matther if we increase or decrease the size of the media whose maxium width will be 900px <br />
                    and minimum width will remain 378px.</p>
    
                    <!-- CSS Units -->
                    <h2>CSS Units</h2>
                    <p>There are many different units that you can use to define sizes in CSS.</p>
                    <h3>Absolute Units</h3>
                    <p>Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context. px is an absolute unit because the size of a pixel doesn’t change relative to anything else on the page.</p>
                    <h3>Relative Units</h3>
                    <p>Relative units are units that can change based on their context. There are several of them that you want to use them.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Percentage Unit (%):</dt>
                        <dd>A percentage that actually based of its parent size. It can be changed according its parent element.</dd>
                        <dt>rem and em</dt>
                        <dd>em and rem both refer to a font size, though they are often used to define other sizes in CSS.
                            1em is the font-size of an element (or the element&apos;s parent if you&apos;re using it to set font-size). So, for example, if an element&apos;s font-size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em would make its width 64px (16 * 4 == 64).
                            1rem is the font-size of the root element (either :root or html). The math works the same with rem as it did with em, but without the added complexity of keeping track of the parent&apos;s font size. Relying on em could mean that a particular size could change if the context changes, which is very likely not the behavior you want.
                            rem short for 'root em'. rem : a CSS unit which is relative to the font size of the html element. em : a CSS unit which is relative to the font size of the parent element.</dd>
                        <dt>Viewport Units:</dt>
                        <dd>The units vh and vw relate to the size of the viewport. Specifically, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width. Thus 100vw will take of the entire width and 50vw obviously it would take of halt the width. These can be useful any time you want something to be sized relative to the viewport, examples including full-height heroes, full-screen app-like interfaces. But the important thing about vw, vh and percentages is that viewport units are based on the entire screen size while percentages are relative to their parent</dd>
                    </dl>
    
                    <!-- Transations -->
                    <h2>Transations</h2>
                    <p>Transion enables us to define the transition between two states of an element. <br />
                    To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the CSS property you want to add effect to</li>
                        <li>the duration of the effect</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>The following example shows a 100px * 100px red &lt;div&gt; element. The &lt;div&gt; element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            div {
                                width: 100px;
                                height: 100px;
                                background: red;
                                transition: width 2s;
                              }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value. <br />
                    Now, let us specify a new value for the width property when a user mouses over the &lt;div&gt; element:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            div:hover {
                                width: 300px;
                              }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
    
                    <h3>Change Several Property Values</h3>

                    <h2>Animations</h2>
                    <p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. <br />
                        You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. <br />
                        To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. <br />
                        Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>@keyframes	Specifies the animation code</li>
                        <li>animation	A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties</li>
                        <li>animation-delay	Specifies a delay for the start of an animation</li>
                        <li>animation-direction	Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles</li>
                        <li>animation-duration	Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle</li>
                        <li>animation-fill-mode	Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both)</li>
                        <li>animation-iteration-count	Specifies the number of times an animation should be played</li>
                        <li>animation-name	Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation</li>
                        <li>animation-play-state	Specifies whether the animation is running or paused</li>
                        <li>animation-timing-function	Specifies the speed curve of the animation</li>

                    <p>In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).
                        It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.</p>
